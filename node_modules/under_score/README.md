# under_score

under_score puts the _ in undersocre. Lame joke aside, under_socre is simply an extension to the very awesome
underscore:  add some useful (or not so useful, depending on your point of view) helpers to _.

./lib/under_score.js is amply commented, read it for apis and documentation.

./test/test_under_score.js contains examples.
